# SunnySideUp
iOS Weather App using OpenWeatherMap API

Sunny Side Up is an iOS app that displays the current temperature as well as the 5 day forecast. The weather data is accessed via OpenWeatherMap's API. In Weather.Swift and Forecast.Swift I created structs used to retrieve the data from GetWeather.swift's json decoder calls. I displayed the current temperature, alongside the city and date, in a simple view in CurrentWeatherViewController.swift. In ForecastTableViewController.swift, I laid out the weather forecast in expandable table view cells utilizing UIButtons as headers.
